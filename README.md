# Simlation of Multi-Wire Proportional Chamber (MWPC) as part of 2024 CERN Summer Internship
This repository holds .C files with CMake Makefiles to build an application which simulates and visualises the signal outputs of MWPC, a gaseous particle detector developed at CERN.
Four configurations are presented with different number of layers and cathode architectures (foil vs. wires).
